# Assignments

We will have two assignments early on.
These assignments can be implemented in any programming language.
(We have done them in the Scheme programming language.)

## _BUS_: Bottom-Up Search

## _Dan_: Synthesizer of Recursive Functions

_Dan_ writes recursive functions in the style of Daniel P. Friedman (_The Little Schemer_, _The Little Learner_).
_Dan_ calls _BUS_ to solve cases, both base cases and recursive cases.
