# Assignments

We will have two assignments early on.
These assignments can be implemented in any programming language(s).
(We have done them in the Scala, Python and Scheme.)

## _BUS_: Bottom-Up Search

_BUS_ is the non-ML subset of [_BUSTLE_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14381).

Your task is to implement bottom-up enumerative search for simple compound expressions, excluding conditionals, recursion and loops.

You can pick your own target language as well. We have picked a subset of Scheme as well as a FlashFill-like string manipulation DSL.

## _Dan_: Synthesizer of Recursive Functions

_Dan_ writes recursive functions in the style taught by Daniel P. Friedman (_The Little Schemer_, _The Little Learner_).
_Dan_ calls _BUS_ to solve cases, both base cases and recursive cases.
