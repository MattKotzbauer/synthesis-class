# Program Synthesis

In this graduate seminar, we will look at the art of program synthesis:
writing programs that write programs based on specifications such as input/output examples.

Topics include inductive synthesis, bottom up search, top down search, version space algebra, constraints, miniKanren, SMT, abstract interpretation, neural guided search.

Students will design and implement [two assignments](assignments.html) and a final project in the language(s) of their choice.
Each student will also present a paper and lead the discussion for one session.
