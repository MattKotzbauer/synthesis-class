# Flyer for CS252R Fall 2023

This year, our exploration takes us to the cutting-edge field of program synthesis. Often considered the pinnacle of programming language research and even equivalent to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), program synthesis is the process of automatically discovering a program that satisfies a high-level specification. 

Program synthesis has the potential to revolutionize computing by automating repetitive tasks to reduce manual coding, enabling non-programmers to create software, and optimizing code for performance and efficiency. Its applications extend to automatic code repair, educational support for teaching programming, accessibility tooling, theorem proving, and even game development, unleashing new levels of creativity and efficiency across various domains.

## What Will You Learn?

- **Classic Methods**: Dive into the foundational techniques for program synthesis, such as Stochastic Search-Based Synthesis, which explores the program space using methods like Monte Carlo techniques; Symbolic Program Synthesis, relying on logical reasoning to generate compliant programs; Genetic Programming, utilizing evolutionary algorithms to evolve programs; and Inductive Program Synthesis, inferring programs from examples such as input-output pairs.
- **Neural Approaches**: Explore the integration of deep learning in synthesis, including Neural-Guided Program Synthesis, which leverages neural networks and deep learning techniques to guide the creation of programs.
- **Multidisciplinary Insights**: Understand how ideas from Programming Languages (PL), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), algorithms, and more have influenced and shaped the field of program synthesis.

## Course Structure:

- **Two Warm-Up Assignments**: Get hands-on with guided projects.
- **Paper Presentation & Discussion**: Lead the conversation on seminal research.
- **Final Project**: Pursue an in-depth inquiry on a topic of your choice.
- **Guest Lectures**: Engage with industry researchers working at the cutting edge of program synthesis.
