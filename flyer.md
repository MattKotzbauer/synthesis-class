# Flyer for CS252R Fall 2013

This year, our exploration takes us to the cutting-edge field of program synthesis. Arguably considered the pinnacle of programming language research and even equivalent to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), program synthesis is the process of automatically discovering a program that satisfies a higher-level specification. 

## What Will You Learn?


- **Classic Methods**: Dive into the foundational techniques for program synthesis. 
- **Neural Approaches**: Explore the integration of deep learning (e.g., Large Language Models) in synthesis.
- **Multidisciplinary Insights**: Learn ideas from PL, AI, HCI, algorithms, â€¦.

## Course Structure:

- **Two Warm-Up Assignments**: Get hands-on with guided projects.
- **Paper Presentation & Discussion**: Lead the conversation on seminal research.
- **Final Project**: Pursue an in-depth inquiry on a topic of your choice.

Join us in CS252R!
